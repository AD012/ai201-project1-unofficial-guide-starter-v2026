# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:**
not set by a character count. Chunks are one ## section each, which lands them at 94 chunks averaging 319 characters (range 183–758). The corpus is 14 markdown guides where every section is already one self-contained topic — a character budget would cut across those boundaries for no benefit. The starter's 800-character window opened 35 of its 51 chunks mid-word.

**Overlap:**
0. Overlap exists to repair damage from cutting in the wrong place. Cutting on headings never cuts in the wrong place, and duplicated sentences would compete against each other for slots in the top-5.

**Context prefix** Nine of the fourteen documents are town guides sharing the identical seven headings, and 61 of their 63 sections never name their own town. Stored raw, there would be nine interchangeable "Getting there" chunks. Each chunk's text therefore opens with Town — Heading.

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

`Getting around the region with limited mobility

An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are
difficult and it is better to know in advance.

## Straightforward

**Thornby Wells** is the easiest town in the region. It is flat, compact, and
everything is within three minutes of everything else. Parking is free for two
hours anywhere in town and the station is central. The pump room and gardens
are level throughout.

**Marchwood** has a modern tram network with level boarding on all four lines,
running every 8 minutes on weekdays. The city museum and covered market are both
step-free. The distances between districts are the main consideration.

**Brightwater** is level along the river and through the centre. The mill museum
is step-free. The station is a 15-

the second village is 12th century and always unlocked.

## Where to stay

Perhaps thirty beds in the entire valley, spread across two pubs and a handful of farmhouse rooms. In summer these are booked months ahead. Camping is permitted on two marked fields and nowhere else.

## When to go

May to September. Outside those months the pub in the third village closes, the farm shop reduces its hours, and several footpaths become genuinely boggyrather than merely wet. The road is not gritted above the second village and is impassable in snow.

## Practical notes

Cash is still useful at the market and in smaller places, though cards are
accepted almost everywhere now. Mobile coverage is good in the centre and
patchy on the outskirts. The nearest full hospital is in Brightwater; there is
a mino


**Chunk 3** — source: `guide_givens_mill.md#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::fallback_split`

# Givens Mill

Givens Mill is a village of 700 built around a working watermill that still grinds flour commercially. It is the sort of place people visit for an afternoon and then talk about for longer than the visit lasted.

## Getting there

No station and no bus on Sundays; four buses a day from Brightwater on weekdays, taking 30 minutes. Driving is 20 minutes. The village car park holds about forty cars and is full by 11am on summer Saturdays.

## Getting around

Everything is on one street along the river. The mill is at one end and the church at the other, eight minutes apart. The riverside path continues in both directions for as far as you want to walk.

## Eat and drink

A tearoom attached to the mill, open 10 to 4 daily except Tuesdays, which sells bread made from the flour grou

oncentrate on weekday daytimes. Sunday service is minimal to non-existent
outside the Brightwater town routes.

The Kestrelford service is hourly on weekdays, two-hourly on Saturdays, and
does not run on Sundays. The Halden Bay coast service runs four times daily
year-round.

## Driving

Roads are good between the towns and poor on the approaches to both Kestrelford
and Halden Bay. The Kestrelford approach is single-track with passing places
for the final eight minutes. The Halden Bay coast road is cut into the cliff
and is slow rather than difficult.

Parking is the constraint rather than driving. Both Halden Bay lots fill by
10am on summer weekends. Kestrelford's lower car park is free and involves a
steep walk up.

## Walking and cycling

The river path from Brightwater runs four miles

For each one, ask: could someone answer a questi

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:**
How do I get to Corry Vale?

Gate: best distance 0.313, under the 0.67 cutoff

**Answer:**
A: According to guide_corry_vale.md, visitors drive from Brightwater (35 minutes on a good road to the valley mouth and another 20 on a poor one) or cycle in, though cycling is a serious undertaking with a 400-metre climb in the first four miles. There is also a school bus into the valley that will carry passengers if there is room, as there is no other public transport.

**My relevance cutoff:**

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

top_k = 8. Chosen by measuring where the chunk containing each answer actually ranks: 1, 1, 1, 3, and 8. At the starter's k=5, "How do I get to Corry Vale?" retrieved Where to stay, What to see, Getting around and When to go — every Corry Vale section except Getting there, which holds the answer. The gate passed at 0.3125, so the system would have answered confidently from the wrong section. k=8 is the smallest value that reaches every gold chunk; it costs about 640 tokens per call.

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

THRESHOLD = 0.67. Measured, not guessed:

In scope		Out of scope	
Population of Kestrelford	0.2689	Capital of Mongolia	0.8104

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1.**
I used Claude code for wirting the chunking function, it kept return fallback_split(documents) even though it was unnecessary. So, I removed it.
**2.**
Used Calude to fingure out the most ambiguous question with no unique answers, and then I decided to make that question ask something more specific.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
